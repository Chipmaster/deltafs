DEFS (DElta FileSystem) is a FUSE (FileSystem in UserSpace) filesystem designed to minimize the storage space tasked with storing multiple copies of files with small differences.  When operating on a defs filesystem, the hard link system call (triggered by ln or cp -l) is replaced with a 'firm link' implementation, the goal being a middle ground between hard links (where no extra space is taken, but the resulting file is immutable) and a full copy (where twice the space is taken).  The firm links can be read transparently by the filesystem.
